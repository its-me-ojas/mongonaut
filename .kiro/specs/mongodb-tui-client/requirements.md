# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A terminal-native TUI (Text User Interface) client for MongoDB and NoSQL document stores that enables developers to perform full data-browsing, querying, and collection/document-level operations without leaving the terminal. The application prioritizes keyboard-first interaction, minimal resource usage, and server-friendly operation while providing comprehensive database management capabilities.

## Glossary

- **TUI Client**: The terminal-based user interface application for MongoDB interaction
- **Connection Manager**: Component responsible for establishing and maintaining MongoDB connections via URI
- **Database Browser**: Interface component for navigating and selecting databases
- **Collection Explorer**: Interface component for viewing and managing collections within a database
- **Document Viewer**: Component for displaying individual documents in readable format
- **Query Engine**: Component that processes and executes MongoDB queries and aggregation pipelines
- **Export Handler**: Component responsible for exporting query results to various formats
- **Keyboard Handler**: Component that processes keyboard shortcuts and navigation commands

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to MongoDB instances using connection URIs, so that I can access my databases from the terminal without GUI tools

3. IF the connection fails, THEN THE Connection Manager SHALL display a specific error message indicating the failure reason
4. THE TUI Client SHALL support standard MongoDB connection string formats including authentication credentials
5. WHEN a connection is established, THE TUI Client SHALL display the connected server information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse all databases and collections in a hierarchical view, so that I can quickly navigate to the data I need

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to a MongoDB instance, THE Database Browser SHALL display a list of all available databases
2. WHEN the user selects a database, THE Collection Explorer SHALL display all collections within that database
3. THE Database Browser SHALL display the number of collections for each database
4. THE Collection Explorer SHALL display document count and size information for each collection
5. THE TUI Client SHALL support keyboard navigation using arrow keys and vim-style keybindings for browsing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view documents within a collection with filtering capabilities, so that I can examine specific data without writing complex queries

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a collection, THE Document Viewer SHALL display documents in a paginated format with 20 documents per page
2. THE Document Viewer SHALL render documents in a readable JSON format with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN the user applies a filter, THE Query Engine SHALL execute the filter and THE Document Viewer SHALL display matching documents within 2 seconds
4. THE TUI Client SHALL support basic filter operations including field equality, comparison operators, and text search
5. THE Document Viewer SHALL allow navigation between documents using keyboard shortcuts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute MongoDB aggregation pipelines, so that I can perform complex data transformations and analysis

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TUI Client SHALL provide an aggregation pipeline editor accepting valid MongoDB aggregation syntax
2. WHEN the user submits an aggregation pipeline, THE Query Engine SHALL execute the pipeline and display results within 5 seconds
3. IF the aggregation pipeline contains syntax errors, THEN THE Query Engine SHALL display error messages with line numbers
4. THE TUI Client SHALL display aggregation results in the same format as document viewing
5. THE Query Engine SHALL support all standard MongoDB aggregation stages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform CRUD operations on documents, so that I can manage data directly from the terminal

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a document, THE TUI Client SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or duplicate the document
2. WHEN the user edits a document, THE TUI Client SHALL open an editor with the document in JSON format
3. WHEN the user saves changes, THE Query Engine SHALL update the document and display a confirmation message
4. WHEN the user deletes a document, THE TUI Client SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
5. THE TUI Client SHALL provide a create new document option that opens an empty JSON editor

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export query results to files, so that I can use the data in other tools or share it with team members

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing query results, THE TUI Client SHALL provide an export command accessible via keyboard shortcut
2. THE Export Handler SHALL support exporting to JSON, CSV, and BSON formats
3. WHEN the user initiates export, THE Export Handler SHALL prompt for file path and format selection
4. THE Export Handler SHALL write the exported file within 10 seconds for result sets under 10,000 documents
5. WHEN export completes, THE TUI Client SHALL display the file path and number of documents exported

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts for all major operations, so that I can work efficiently without reaching for the mouse

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Keyboard Handler SHALL support navigation shortcuts for moving between databases, collections, and documents
2. THE TUI Client SHALL display a help screen showing all available keyboard shortcuts when the user presses the help key
3. THE Keyboard Handler SHALL support vim-style navigation keys (h, j, k, l) in addition to arrow keys
4. THE TUI Client SHALL provide shortcuts for common operations including search, filter, export, and refresh
5. THE Keyboard Handler SHALL process keyboard input with latency under 50 milliseconds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TUI to be responsive and lightweight, so that I can run it on remote servers with limited resources

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TUI Client SHALL start up within 2 seconds on systems with 512MB available RAM
2. THE TUI Client SHALL consume less than 50MB of memory during normal operation
3. THE TUI Client SHALL render UI updates within 100 milliseconds of user input
4. THE TUI Client SHALL maintain responsive performance when displaying collections with over 1 million documents
5. THE TUI Client SHALL operate correctly over SSH connections with latency up to 200 milliseconds

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage collections including creating, dropping, and renaming, so that I can perform database administration tasks

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing collections, THE TUI Client SHALL provide options to create new collections
2. WHEN the user creates a collection, THE TUI Client SHALL prompt for collection name and validation rules
3. WHEN the user drops a collection, THE TUI Client SHALL require confirmation and display the collection name
4. THE TUI Client SHALL support renaming collections with validation to prevent name conflicts
5. WHEN collection operations complete, THE Collection Explorer SHALL refresh to reflect changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view database statistics and indexes, so that I can monitor performance and optimize queries

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a database, THE Database Browser SHALL display storage size, number of collections, and total documents
2. WHEN viewing a collection, THE Collection Explorer SHALL display index information including index names and keys
3. THE TUI Client SHALL provide a statistics view showing query execution times and document scan counts
